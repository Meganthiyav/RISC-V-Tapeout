# Environment Setup

   To get started with the workshop, we first need to prepare the working setup.

1. **Make a new directory called `VSD`**
   This directory will serve as the main workspace throughout the workshop.

   ```bash
   mkdir VSD
   ```

2. **Launch the terminal inside the `VSD` directory**
   Move into the folder so that all files and projects are stored in the right location.

   ```bash
   cd VSD
   ```

3. **Download the workshop repository**
   Use the following command to clone it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
   ```

### Details of the Repository

The repository (**sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop**) contains everything needed for RTL design and synthesis practice:

* **Sample RTL Designs** – Verilog implementations of different circuits.
* **Pre-built Libraries** – standard modules that assist in building and testing designs.
* **Yosys Automation Script** – a ready-made script to simplify synthesis runs.
* **Workshop Resources** – supporting files and content for the Sky130 RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop.
