## 1: Introduction to Icarus Verilog (iverilog)
**Objective:**
Gain a foundational understanding of how Icarus Verilog is utilized for Register Transfer Level (RTL) simulation, and comprehend the role and structure of a testbench in verifying digital designs.

### **Key Concepts:**

### **1. Simulator**

* A **simulator** is a software tool used to **validate the functional correctness** of digital hardware designs prior to synthesis or implementation.
* In this course, we employ **Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`)**, an open-source Verilog simulation and synthesis tool, to perform RTL simulations.

### **2. Testbench**

* A **testbench** is a non-synthesizable Verilog module designed to **stimulate the design under test (DUT)** and monitor its outputs.
* It provides a controlled environment in which the design is exercised through various input scenarios.
** A testbench does **not contain any primary inputs or outputs**, unlike the DUT, which typically interfaces with external signals.

### **3. Simulation Flow**

* The simulation engine continuously **monitors signal activity** within the design.
* When a signal (typically an input) changes, the simulator **recalculates the resulting outputs** according to the design logic.
* If no signal changes occur, the simulation state remains static.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**
>
> * The DUT (Design Under Test) can have **one or more primary input and output ports**, depending on the design requirements.
> * In contrast, a **testbench operates independently of any external I/O** and is solely intended for simulation purposes.


### **RTL Simulation Workflow**

```bash
# Step 1: Compile the design and testbench files
iverilog -o simulation_out design.v testbench.v

# Step 2: Execute the simulation and generate waveform output
vvp simulation_out

# Step 3: Open the waveform dump in GTKWave for analysis
gtkwave dump.vcd
```

* The `.vcd` (Value Change Dump) file captures all relevant signal transitions over time.
* This file can be loaded into **GTKWave**, a waveform viewer, to perform **temporal analysis** and **functional verification** of the RTL behavior prior to synthesis.
