# 4.Introduction to yosys

## synthesizer:
  A tool to convert RTL Design to Netlist.

# Yosys:
 * Yosys is an open-source tool used for **logic synthesis** in digital design.
* It translates **Verilog RTL code** into a gate-level netlist.
* The **primary inputs and outputs** of the synthesized netlist remain the same as the original design.
* Netlist verification can be done by simulating it and viewing waveforms in **GTKWave**.
* The **same testbench** used for RTL simulation can also be reused for netlist verification.
