## Day:3 Working with iVerilog and GTKWave

To practice digital simulation, weâ€™ll use the **sample Verilog codes** available in the cloned repository inside:

```
verilog_files/
```

Every example project includes:

* **Design module** (e.g., `good_mux.v`) â€“ describes the actual circuit logic.
* **Testbench module** (e.g., `tb_good_mux.v`) â€“ supplies test inputs and verifies the designâ€™s behavior.

---

### Step-by-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Move into the Verilog folder**
Open a terminal and switch to the folder containing the Verilog examples:

```bash
cd VSD/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

 This ensures all compile and run commands happen in the right place.

---

**Step 2: Select your design and testbench**

* Choose one Verilog design file from the folder.
* Each design has a matching testbench.

ðŸ’¡ Example: `good_mux.v` (design) â†” `tb_good_mux.v` (testbench)

---

**Step 3: Compile using iVerilog**

```bash
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

This generates an executable file named `a.out`.
It is the compiled simulation that combines your design and testbench.

---

**Step 4: Run the simulation**

```bash
./a.out
```
 Running this produces `tb_good_mux.vcd`, a **VCD (Value Change Dump)** file that logs all signal transitions over time.

---

**Step 5: Visualize with GTKWave**

```bash
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

GTKWave opens a waveform viewer where you can see how inputs vary and how the design reacts at each time step.
This makes it easy to confirm if the circuit behaves as expected.
