## Day:3 Working with iVerilog and GTKWave

To practice digital simulation, we’ll use the **sample Verilog codes** available in the cloned repository inside:

```
verilog_files/
```

Every example project includes:

* **Design module** (e.g., `good_mux.v`) – describes the actual circuit logic.
* **Testbench module** (e.g., `tb_good_mux.v`) – supplies test inputs and verifies the design’s behavior.

---

### Step-by-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Move into the Verilog folder**
Open a terminal and switch to the folder containing the Verilog examples:

```bash
cd VSD/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

 This ensures all compile and run commands happen in the right place.

---

**Step 2: Select your design and testbench**

* Choose one Verilog design file from the folder.
* Each design has a matching testbench.

💡 Example: `good_mux.v` (design) ↔ `tb_good_mux.v` (testbench)

---

**Step 3: Compile using iVerilog**

```bash
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

This generates an executable file named `a.out`.
It is the compiled simulation that combines your design and testbench.

---

**Step 4: Run the simulation**

```bash
./a.out
```
 Running this produces `tb_good_mux.vcd`, a **VCD (Value Change Dump)** file that logs all signal transitions over time.

---

**Step 5: Visualize with GTKWave**

```bash
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

GTKWave opens a waveform viewer where you can see how inputs vary and how the design reacts at each time step.
This makes it easy to confirm if the circuit behaves as expected.

Simulation Flow

Design File + Testbench
      ->
Compile with iVerilog → a.out
      ->
Run ./a.out → generates VCD file
      ->
Open in GTKWave → View waveforms

## Quick Command Reference

Navigate to folder:

```bash
cd VSD/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

Compile:

```bash
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

Run:

```bash
./a.out
```

View in GTKWave:

```bash
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```
