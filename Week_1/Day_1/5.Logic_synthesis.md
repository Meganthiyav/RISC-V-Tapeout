# 5.Logic synthesis 
# RTL:
RTL is the behavioural representation of the specifications.

# Synthesis :
  -> The process which transforms RTL code to Digital logic circuit (gate level).
  -> This gate level file is called Netlist.

    ```
    RTL code + Frontend lib 
              |
         synthesis
              |
           Netlist

    ```


# What is .lib ?
-> .lib is a collection of logical modules.

-> It has all basic logic gates.

-> It also have different flavours of same gate.

-> EX : 2 INP NAND :

      > slow
      
      > medium
      
      > Fast

# Why do we need different flavours of same type?
  They help optiize Time , Poower , Area similtaneously.

 Tclk > T1 + Tcombi + T2 

 Here Tclk should be greater than the total time required for the process to completee so as to have high efficiency.
The fastest time taken to complete a process depends on the the slowest time taken for the completion of the process
