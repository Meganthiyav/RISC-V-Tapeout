# Synthesis with yosys

1. **Start Yosys**

   ```
   yosys
   ```

   This launches the Yosys interactive shell where all synthesis commands are executed.

---

2. **Load the Liberty file**

   ```
   read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```

   The Liberty file (`.lib`) describes the timing, power, and functional behavior of each standard cell in the Sky130 library.
   Loading this ensures Yosys knows *what cells exist* and *how they behave* when mapping your RTL to actual silicon.

---

3. **Read the Verilog design**

   ```
   read_verilog good_mux.v
   ```

   Imports your RTL (Register Transfer Level) Verilog source. At this stage, the design is still abstract logic (muxes, adders, behavioral statements) and not tied to any physical cell library.

---

4. **Run synthesis**

   ```
   synth -top good_mux
   ```

   Converts the RTL into a generic gate-level representation (basic logic gates, flip-flops, etc.).
   The `-top` option tells Yosys which module is the entry point of the design.

---

5. **Technology mapping**

   ```
   dfflibmap -liberty ~/vsd/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   abc -liberty   ~/vsd/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```

   * `dfflibmap` replaces generic flip-flops with actual Sky130 flip-flop cells.
   * `abc` maps and optimizes the combinational logic (AND, OR, MUX, etc.) into available standard cells while considering timing and area.
     After this, your design is fully expressed in terms of Sky130 cells, making it technology-specific.

6. **Visualize the synthesized netlist**

   ```
   show
   ```

   Opens a schematic diagram generated by Yosys. This helps confirm whether the synthesized structure matches your design intent.

---

7. **Export the gate-level netlist**

   ```
   write_verilog ~/good_mux_netlist.v
   ```

   Writes the synthesized and technology-mapped design into a Verilog file. This gate-level netlist contains only Sky130 cells (no behavioral constructs). It’s the version used for downstream verification, simulation, or physical design.

---

8. **Generate synthesis statistics**

   ```
   stat
   ```

   Produces a resource utilization report — number of cells, cell types used, and hierarchy information. This is useful to estimate design size, complexity, and efficiency.
